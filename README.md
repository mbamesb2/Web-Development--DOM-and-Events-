CS 290 Web Development: DOM and Javascript Events Assignment

For this assignment, I built a table in Javascript that is generated
when the page is loaded. Then, using event listeners, I added
navigation functionality to the table. You can click the directional
buttons, then mark a cell by clicking “Mark Cell”.
